## Flow Optimization Notes

### High-Frequency Paths (Optimized)
- **J1/J2**: 2-3 taps to log food from Home
- **J7**: Zero taps - progress visible immediately

### Pain Points Identified
- **J5 (Manual Entry)**: Most steps, highest friction - consider inline quick-add
- **J6 (Scan)**: Depends on camera/recognition accuracy

### Cross-Flow Connections
- J4 (Search) → J5 (Manual Entry) when food not found
- J6 (Scan) → J5 (Manual Entry) when recognition fails
- J1/J2/J3/J4 all converge at Choose Portion Size popup
